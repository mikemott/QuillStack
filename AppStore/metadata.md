## Description (4000 character limit)

Transform your handwritten notes into organized, searchable digital content with QuillStack.

**CAPTURE WITH PRECISION**
Point your camera at any handwritten note and QuillStack instantly converts it to editable text using advanced OCR technology. Our three-pronged accuracy system combines Apple's latest Vision framework with intelligent spell correction and word-level confidence tracking.

**SMART CLASSIFICATION**
Simply write a hashtag trigger like #todo# or #email# on your note, and QuillStack automatically organizes it:

• Todo lists with checkable tasks and progress tracking
• Email drafts with parsed To/Subject fields and one-tap sending
• Meeting notes with attendees, agendas, and action items
• Claude prompts ready to export as GitHub Issues

**CONFIDENCE HIGHLIGHTING**
Not sure if a word was recognized correctly? Low-confidence words are underlined so you can tap to see alternatives or make corrections. QuillStack learns from your corrections and improves over time.

**AI-POWERED ENHANCEMENT**
Connect your Claude API key to clean up OCR text, fix remaining errors, and improve formatting—all while preserving your original intent. Works offline too; requests queue up and sync when you're back online.

**DEVELOPER WORKFLOW**
Write feature ideas on paper, then export them as structured GitHub Issues. Perfect for Claude Code workflows and capturing ideas when you're away from your keyboard.

**SEAMLESS INTEGRATION**
• Export to Apple Notes, Obsidian, or Notion
• Create calendar events from meeting notes
• Send todos to the Reminders app
• Share via PDF or plain text

**YOUR DATA, YOUR CONTROL**
QuillStack stores everything locally on your device with optional iCloud sync. Bring your own API keys—we never see your data.
